# To do
  - Implement custom format for geometry
  - Implement custom format for shaders
  - Develop a model converter which uses Assimp to "compile" resources to the formats we want (see ./compiled_resources_example/)
  - Implement model loading from compiled formats

  - Make it possible to use normal mapping (tangents, bitangents, etc.)
  - Look into skeletal animation
  - Create file which maps together materials with geometry, shaders, textures etc. (XML? JSON? Binary?)
