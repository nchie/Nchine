# To do

  - Clean up and improve model importing
  - Create class for texture loading
  - Make it possible to use normal mapping (tangents, bitangents, etc.)
  - Look into skeletal animation
  - Create own (separate) format for geometry
  - Create file which maps together materials with geometry, shaders, textures etc. (XML? JSON? Binary?)
