# Nchine

This is an abandoned project for learning OpenGL and rendering, and I while I doubt it's useful to anyone, you never know! It is written in C++17 with OpenGL 3.3, implements [deferred shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading), and uses the [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library to import models.
