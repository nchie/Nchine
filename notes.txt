| RESOURCE SYSTEM |
 -----------------

Classes:
    * Geometry: holds and manages everything needed to render a geometry: VAO, VBO, EBO.
    * Texture: holds and manages a texture which is loaded into the GPU.
    * Shader: holds and manages a shader which is loaded into the GPU.

    * Material: holds a shader resource, multiple texture resources, as well as uniform settings.
    * Mesh: holds a geometry and a material.
    * Model: holds multiple meshes, possibly in a tree structure to more easily support skinning later on?

    * ResourceCache<T>: T can be any resource loaded into the GPU. It owns these resources and only hands out handles to
                        them on request (currently string identifiers are used when requesting handles, but all resources
                        are stored in a vector and each handle only contains resource's index in that vector)
    * Resource<T>:      The handles given out from ResourceCache. The handles are reference counted and to get the
                        underlying resource you simply deference like with pointers (*handle).



XMLs documents:
    * Resources.xml for ref-counted resources (geometry, shaders, textures)
        - Resources are assigned names and resource files, and possibly some attributes
        - Are reference counted using ResourceCache<T>

    * Assets.xml for assets using the resources (materials, meshes, models)
        - Assets are not reference counted, but they hold handles to ref-counted resources.

Both XMLs are loaded into memory (possibly with class called Resource/AssetDefinitions containing entries in std::maps?)


Factory classes for resources:
For example, a texture factory could contain the texture definitions from the XML containing data about textures in the game,
as well as a cache containing all loaded textures. This means it has mappings from each name/id to a file and when asked
to load a texture with a name/id, it can look up its path and use a "BinaryLoader" to either load it directly, or
asynchronously load the binary data into a queue which then can be read from later to create the resources synchronously
in the GL context. These factories only return handles.

Factory classes for assets:
Much like for resources, these classes contain the definitions for the assets they can load. For example, with the
definition the MaterialFactory will know which shader, textures and possibly uniform a certain material has, and with
the help of TextureFactory and ShaderFactory, it can retrieve handles to the resources it needs (Shader + Textures),
setup (uniforms), and return an instance of requested material. These factories return actual instances, not handles!
